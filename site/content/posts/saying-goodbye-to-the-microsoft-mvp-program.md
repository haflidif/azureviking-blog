It's been an incredible journey, and today I want to share some exciting news along with a heartfelt farewell to the Microsoft MVP Program.

## Who are MVPs?

> Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals, or MVPs, are technology experts who passionately share their knowledge with the community. They are always on the "bleeding edge" and have an unstoppable urge to get their hands on new, exciting technologies. They have very deep knowledge of Microsoft products and services, while also being able to bring together diverse platforms, products and solutions, to solve real-world problems. MVPs make up a global community of over 3,000 technical experts and community leaders across 90+ countries/regions and are driven by their passion, community spirit, and quest for knowledge.

## My Journey

My journey with the MVP program has been nothing short of extraordinary. When I first received the news that I had been awarded the Microsoft MVP title, it was a moment of immense pride and validation. It was recognition of the countless hours spent contributing to the community, writing blog posts, speaking at events, and helping others navigate the ever-evolving world of Microsoft technologies.

## Visiting Redmond for the MVP Summit

One of the highlights of being an MVP was the opportunity to visit Redmond for the MVP Summit. Meeting fellow MVPs from around the world, engaging directly with Microsoft product teams, and getting a sneak peek at upcoming technologies — it was an experience that fueled my passion for technology even further.

The connections I made during the summit have turned into lasting friendships and professional relationships that I will cherish forever. The energy and enthusiasm of the MVP community is truly unmatched.

## Receiving My 2nd MVP Award

To make things even more special, I was honored to receive my 2nd MVP award — this time in two categories. This recognition across multiple areas of expertise was a testament to the breadth of community work and the passion I have for multiple facets of Microsoft technology.

## A New Chapter: Joining Microsoft

Now, for the exciting news — I am thrilled to announce that I have joined Microsoft as a **Senior Cloud Solution Architect - Security**. This new role is a dream come true, and it represents the next step in my career journey.

However, with this transition comes the bittersweet reality of leaving the MVP program. As a Microsoft employee, I am no longer eligible for the MVP award. While saying goodbye to the MVP title is not easy, I am incredibly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.

## Continuing Community Contributions

Just because I am no longer an MVP does not mean I will stop contributing to the community. On the contrary — being at Microsoft gives me even more opportunities to engage with the community, share knowledge, and help others succeed with Microsoft technologies.

I plan to continue:

- Writing blog posts and technical articles
- Speaking at community events and conferences
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Engaging with the community on social media and forums

## Looking Forward

I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who has been part of this journey — the MVP community, the Microsoft MVP program team, and all of you who have supported me along the way. Your encouragement and support have been invaluable.

As I step into this new role, I carry with me the lessons, experiences, and connections from my time as an MVP. The future is bright, and I cannot wait to see what lies ahead.

Thank you for being part of my journey. Here's to new beginnings! 🚀
