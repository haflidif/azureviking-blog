## Pros

1. **On-device biometric verification** — Fingerprint data never leaves the device, providing an additional layer of security compared to keys that rely solely on PIN codes.
2. **Built-in display** — The integrated display shows transaction details and authentication requests, enabling the user to verify what they are approving before confirming.
3. **Bluetooth and NFC connectivity** — Supports both Bluetooth and NFC, making it compatible with a wide range of devices including smartphones, tablets, and computers.
4. **FIDO2/WebAuthn compliant** — Fully compliant with FIDO2 and WebAuthn standards, ensuring broad compatibility with services that support passwordless authentication.
5. **No USB port required** — Unlike many FIDO2 keys, the OFFPAD does not need a USB connection, which is beneficial for devices with limited ports or for mobile-first use cases.
6. **Rechargeable battery** — The built-in rechargeable battery means no need to worry about replacing batteries, and it lasts for an extended period on a single charge.
7. **User-friendly setup** — The initial setup process is straightforward, with clear instructions for enrolling fingerprints and pairing with devices.
8. **Cost-efficient in the long run** — While the upfront cost may be higher than basic security keys, the combination of features it offers can replace multiple authentication methods, making it cost-efficient over time.

## Cons

1. **Higher price point** — The OFFPAD is priced higher than many other FIDO2 security keys on the market, which may be a barrier for some users.
2. **Bluetooth pairing quirks** — Bluetooth pairing can occasionally be finicky, particularly when switching between multiple devices.
3. **Limited ecosystem support** — While FIDO2 support is growing, not all services and platforms fully support all features of the OFFPAD, particularly the display-based transaction confirmation.
4. **Bulkier than traditional keys** — Due to the built-in display and battery, the OFFPAD is larger and heavier than minimalist USB security keys, making it less pocket-friendly.

## Conclusion

The PONE Biometrics OFFPAD is an innovative and feature-rich FIDO2 authentication device. It pushes the boundaries of what a security key can do by incorporating biometrics, a display, and wireless connectivity into a single device. While the higher price and larger form factor may not suit everyone, for those who prioritize security and want a comprehensive passwordless solution, the OFFPAD is a compelling choice.

The on-device biometric verification is the standout feature here — knowing that your fingerprint data never leaves the device provides genuine peace of mind. If you are looking for a security key that goes beyond the basics, the OFFPAD is well worth considering.
