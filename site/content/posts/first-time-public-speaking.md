## The Build-Up

If you had told me a year ago that I would be standing in front of an audience presenting about Microsoft Security, I probably would not have believed you. Public speaking was something that always made me nervous — the thought of standing in front of a crowd, all eyes on you, waiting for you to say something brilliant. It was enough to make my palms sweat just thinking about it.

But here I am, writing about my first public speaking experience, and I can tell you — **what a thrill!**

## The Microsoft Security User Group Kick-Off

The opportunity came through the **Microsoft Security User Group**, which was hosting its very first event. The user group was created to bring together professionals who work with Microsoft Security technologies — from Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Sentinel to Entra ID and Conditional Access.

When I was asked if I would like to present at the inaugural event, a mix of excitement and terror washed over me. This was a chance to share my knowledge with the community, to give back, and to connect with like-minded professionals. How could I say no?

## Securing Your Identity and Conditional Access

My topic was **"Securing Your Identity and Conditional Access"** — an area I am deeply passionate about. I believe that identity is the new security perimeter, and Conditional Access is one of the most powerful tools in the Microsoft security toolkit.

I spent weeks preparing my presentation, going through slides, rehearsing demos, and anticipating questions. I wanted to make sure I could deliver real value to the audience, covering:

- Why identity security matters more than ever
- The fundamentals of Conditional Access in Microsoft Entra ID
- Practical scenarios and policy recommendations
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Live demonstrations of Conditional Access policies in action

## The Nerves

The day of the event, I will not lie — I was nervous. Really nervous. As I set up my laptop and tested my slides, I could feel my heart racing. I kept checking my notes, making sure I had not forgotten anything important.

The minutes before my session felt like hours. I watched the audience file in, chatting amongst themselves, and I wondered — would they find my content valuable? Would I stumble over my words? Would the demos work?

## The Relief

And then it happened — I started speaking. And you know what? **The moment I started, the nerves melted away.** It was like a switch flipped. Instead of seeing a room full of judges, I saw a room full of people who were genuinely interested in learning. People who were nodding along, taking notes, and engaging with the content.

The demos worked (thank goodness!), the slides flowed well, and before I knew it, I was in the zone. The passion I have for the topic shone through, and I could feel the audience connecting with the material.

## Audience Engagement

The best part of the experience was the audience engagement. After the presentation, people came up to me with questions, shared their own experiences, and thanked me for the insights. Some told me they were going to implement specific Conditional Access policies I had recommended. Others wanted to continue the conversation and connect on LinkedIn.

It was incredibly rewarding to know that my presentation had provided real, actionable value to the attendees. This is what community is all about — sharing knowledge, learning from each other, and growing together.

## Looking Forward

My first public speaking experience has ignited a passion I did not know I had. The thrill of sharing knowledge with a live audience, the connections made, and the feeling of contributing to the community — it is addictive in the best possible way.

I am now looking forward to more speaking opportunities. Whether it is at user groups, meetups, or conferences, I want to continue sharing my knowledge and experiences with the community.

To anyone who is on the fence about public speaking — **just do it**. Yes, it is scary. Yes, you will be nervous. But the moment you start speaking about something you are passionate about, the nerves will fade, and you will find an experience that is incredibly fulfilling.

Thank you to the Microsoft Security User Group for the opportunity and to everyone who attended the event. Here is to many more! 🎤
