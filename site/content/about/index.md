title: 'A Few Words About Me'
---

Welcome to my blog site! My name is **Haflidi Fridthjofsson**, an Icelandic Technical Fellow and Senior Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft, with over a decade of experience in IT. I am a former **Microsoft MVP in Azure & Security**, recognized for my expertise in Infrastructure as Code and Cloud Security.

My journey in IT began at a young age, with my first contact with computers at the age of 4. Over the years, I have gained extensive experience in cloud solutions, system administration, Office 365, and security solutions. I have managed hosted server environments in on-premise data centers and Azure platforms, designed and implemented countless Office 365 environments, and focused on securing Azure Infrastructure.

In 2018, I moved with my family to Norway, which significantly impacted my career. This move allowed me to join **Avanade Norway** as a Senior Consultant, where I advanced my expertise in Azure Infrastructure, Security, and Modern Workplace. I was later promoted to Manager and Technical Architect within Cloud and Infrastructure.

In early 2023, I joined **Sopra Steria**, Norway's largest consultancy within digitalization, innovation, and sustainability. During the transition period, I was awarded as a Microsoft MVP within Security. In June 2024, I was recognized again with a **double MVP award in Security & Azure**.

In November 2024, I got the exciting opportunity to join **Microsoft** as a Senior Cloud Solution Architect within the Customer Success Unit, working towards the mission to empower every person and organization on the planet to achieve more.

Throughout my career, I have achieved several significant milestones including multiple Microsoft certifications: **Cybersecurity Architect Expert**, **Azure Solutions Architect Expert**, **Azure Administrator Associate**, **Azure Security Engineer Associate**, and **Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator Expert**.

My community contributions have always been a significant part of my career. I co-founded the **Microsoft Security User Group** (1000+ members), contributed to open-source projects, created Terraform modules, and continue sharing knowledge through this blog and speaking engagements.
