In this talk presented at the **Azure User Group Norway**, I introduce Azure Managed DevOps Pools (MDP) — a game-changing service that was in Public Preview at the time.

## What Are Managed DevOps Pools?

Azure Managed DevOps Pools provide a fully managed solution for running your Azure DevOps pipelines. Instead of managing your own self-hosted agents or relying solely on Microsoft-hosted agents, MDP gives you the best of both worlds:

- **Enhanced performance** — Dedicated compute with customizable SKUs
- **Cost efficiency** — Pay only for what you use with auto-scaling
- **Secure network integration** — Run agents inside your own VNet
- **Zero maintenance** — Microsoft manages the infrastructure

## Key Takeaways

- How MDP compares to traditional hosted and self-hosted agents
- Setting up your first Managed DevOps Pool
- Networking and security considerations
- Cost optimization strategies
