Presented at the **Azure User Group Iceland**, this talk is a comprehensive deep dive into Azure networking.

## What This Talk Covers

Azure networking is one of the most fundamental — and complex — areas of cloud architecture. In this session, I break down the key concepts and share practical experience from real-world implementations.

## Topics Covered

- **Virtual Networks & Subnets** — Design patterns and best practices
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** — Rule design, priority management, and common pitfalls
- **Route Tables & UDRs** — Controlling traffic flow in hub-spoke topologies
- **Private Endpoints & Private Link** — Securing PaaS service connectivity
- **Azure DNS** — Private DNS zones, DNS forwarding, and the Azure DNS Private Resolver
- **Network Architecture** — Hub-spoke, Virtual WAN, and Azure Landing Zone network patterns
